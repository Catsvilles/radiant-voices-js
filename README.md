Radiant Voices
==============

Radiant Voices JS lets you read, modify, and write SunVox-compatible
project and synth files.

This is a reimplementation of Radiant Voices for Python.

Rather than being a direct port, this is also a reimagining of the API,
using immutable data structures to represent SunVox objects.
