Radiant Voices JS
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metrasynth/radiant-voices-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metrasynth/radiant-voices-js)

WORK IN PROGRESS! PRE-ALPHA!

Radiant Voices JS lets you read, modify, and write SunVox-compatible
project and synth files.

This is a reimplementation of [Radiant Voices](https://github.com/metrasynth/radiant-voices/),
which was originally written using Python.

Rather than being a direct port, this is also a reimagining of the API,
using [immutable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable) 
data structures to represent SunVox objects,
and [extendable-immutable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extendable-immutable)
to provide some API conveniences.

Until the documentation for Radiant Voices JS is more complete,
you may find the [Radiant Voices docs](https://radiant-voices.rtfd.io/) useful.
In particular, it has detailed information about the
[SunVox file format](https://radiant-voices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sunvox-file-format.html).
